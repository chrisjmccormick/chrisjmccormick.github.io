I think AI art **inspires awe** in us because:



1. It's incredibly **imaginative**.
2. The **artistic technique** is masterful.
3. It was created by an **AI**. 

Unfortunately, what it so masterfully generates also tends to be very **incoherent**.

In my experience, you should probably decline any offers for a ride in a stable diffusion fighter jet... üòú

Browsing libraries of generated imagery, the most popular (and successful) subject to generate seems to be **portraits**.

A head-on perspective, with a lot of **symmetry**, seems to work best. There are strong examples of other perspectives as well, just less common:

If you start going below the shoulders, though, many of your generations will be ‚Äúruined‚Äù by unrealistic posing of limbs or incorrect proportions. 

Most critically, though‚ÄìStable Diffusion v1.5 seems, for all practical purposes, incapable of generating hands and fingers, or the correct interaction between a person's hands and an object.

I'd like to be able to use Stable Diffusion to create a **scene**--a **subject** in a **setting**, interacting with one or more **objects**, like a ‚Äúblacksmith forging a sword in his workshop‚Äù...

It seems clear to me that you‚Äôre just not going to get a polished image straight out of the model on something like this (no matter how much you play with the prompt or settings). 

But there's hope! There are a number of fancy techniques out there that we can try, such as:



* We can use **inpainting** to regenerate a specific object in the scene
* With **outpainting**, we can first generate a subject that we like, and then expand outward to create the setting. 
* Providing a **starting image** can help us dictate the layout of the scene.
* **Compositing** can help us blend in replacements for parts of the image.
* **Fine-tuning** can help it generate a particular subject or style more reliably.

And, while I don‚Äôt want to become a full on graphical artist or photoshop expert, I‚Äôd be willing to pick a few of those tricks here or there to get what I want. üòä

I‚Äôve kicked off a new [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLam9sigHPGwNLOWrCGtJDcBo7oBuJNLy6) to explore all of the above!

I‚Äôve started out providing an introduction to the absolute basics of AI art generation, since there‚Äôs still plenty to learn about **prompt design** and the purpose of the different **settings **before getting to the more advanced techniques I listed. 

I also plan to publish blog posts here and there to cover specific topics. Stay tuned!
